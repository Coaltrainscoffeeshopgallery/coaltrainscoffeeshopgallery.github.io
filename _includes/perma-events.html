        <p>Coaltrain’s Jazz Club runs every Saturday rain or shine form 11am-1pm weekly.

        Each week we celebrate different styles of Jazz from Swing to Be Bop, fusion to cool and contemporary played by musicians in duo to octets. 
        It’s a hustle bustle style event that sits perfectly with the coming and goings of a lively train station. 

        All welcome and entry is free though donations to the musicians involved are essential to keeping to our little Jazz Club swinging. 

        We hope to see you there. (please arrive early to get a seat) 

        Please note that due to health and safety we do not allow push chairs or dogs to this event.  </p>
