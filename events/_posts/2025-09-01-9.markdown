How to name this file so that it will work and show up on the website.

To rename the file, you will have to close this down, right click and press rename. Alternatively, you may be able to go to File in the top left corner and press "save as" which will allow you to save the file with the correct name.

The overall format of the file will be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-#". Below, I will take you through a step by step process on how to name this file correctly.

1)The name of the file needs to include todays date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-" with the dashes. You may notice there is an extra dash after the "DD". This is not a typo and is needed.

2)After the final dash, you will need to put a number however it needs to be a specific number. This is the hardest part to do but not very hard to do. Look at the previous posts you have made on the website and find the largest last number. For example, if I have 3 posts on the website named 2025-06-01-9, 2025-06-02-10, 2025-06-03-11, the largest last number will be 11. As the largest last number is 11, you would need to put the last number for this file as 12 (one above).

3)Double check the "modal-id" in this file. It should be the same number as the number you just put at the end of this file.

4)Finally, upload this file (and any relevant pictures) to the website. This file goes in the folder events/_posts. Any pictures go in the folder img/portfolio.
