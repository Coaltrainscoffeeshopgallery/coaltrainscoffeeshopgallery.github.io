The Book- Dive into a world where magic meets humour in this enchanting collection of 9 short stories, perfect for readers aged 8 to 108. From dragons and gnomes to talking horses and mischievous ghosts. Each tale is a delightful mix of whimsy, satire and wonder. Get ready to laugh, dream and embark on unforgettable adventures! A bit about the author- At school David hated writing. This was due to his dyslexia and dyspraxia though he loved stories in every form. The teachers would say his head was full of sky and it was up in the clouds. Whenever he showed an interest in storey telling he was knocked down. Now formally diagnosed with autism, he has at last found the courage to get the stories out of his head and on to paper- and this book. Inspirational is the word! At Coaltrain’s love to see people exercising their creativity, especially when they go against the odds to do so. We appreciate that sometimes there may be personal hurdles in our way and we will try to help if we can. Life is a journey and the people you meet along the way can make a huge difference to your confidence and motivation and we aim to carry on that positivity where we can. Free entry, All welcome. We hope to see you there. #Put your description here. When
