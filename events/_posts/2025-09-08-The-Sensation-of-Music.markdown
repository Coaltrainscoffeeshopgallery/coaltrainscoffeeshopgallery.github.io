This exhibition is a celebration of the sensation of music and its profound effect on the psyche.

Jade invites her audience to embrace how music awakens a spectrum of emotions, making us feel vividly alive and deeply connected to ourselves.

She encourages visitors to reflect on music’s ability to bring people together, creating space for an authentic connection.

Music is presented here as a universal language that reminds us of our shared humanity.

The Sensation of Music exhibition launch is on Thursday 9th October 5.30pm-8.30pm and runs until Saturday 9th November. 

Free entry, all welcome.

Hope to see you there.❤️"
