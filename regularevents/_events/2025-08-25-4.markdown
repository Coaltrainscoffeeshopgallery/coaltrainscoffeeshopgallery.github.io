description: Every Thursday morning from 10am-12:30pm we invite parents and babies to come along and listen to some nice chilled Jazz tunes. To entertain the kids while you chat or chill. This is a nice easy going event that occasionally features live musicians. It's a great way to meet like minded parents and introduce your kids to music in a chilled social setting. All welcome, free entry.
