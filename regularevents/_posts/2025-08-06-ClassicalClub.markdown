description: "Classical club. Coaltrain’s Classical Club runs once a month on a Sunday morning 11am-12.30pm and is an ideal way to start your Sunday. We have guest duo’s, Trio’s and Quartet’s sharing with us their favourite pieces by their favourite composers both contemporary and historic. Sometimes gentle, sometimes not so much but always delivered with passion.
The next Classical Club features Kirstie Miller on Cello and Christopher Fossey on Piano playing a selection of their favourite compositions from the likes of Elgar, Einaudi , Harriet Bosman and more…
All welcome, free entry though donations to the musicians involved is essential to keeping our little Classical Club going. "
