description: Drawn to Music. Is our monthly improvised music and drawing club. usualy held the first Tuesday of the month with guest musicians ‘Managed Decline’ who provide off the cuff soundscapes for you to immerse into while free flow drawing, painting or writing etc.
We have pens, paints and paper etc for everyone to use though you are welcome to bring your own materials and if your worried about what to draw theres plenty of inspiration around the cafe to draw from or we have a collection of adult and children’s colouring books you can use to help you focus.
This event is for all the family. It’s a great way of trying something different.
All levels welcome.
We especially like to see people having a go for the first time. It’s a very informal, relaxed session that is about being in the moment and seeing where that takes you.
All welcome, free entry through donations to musicians and venue are much appreciated and help keeps our events going.
The next Drawn to Music session is Tuesday 2nd Oct. 6.30pm-8.30pm
Hope to see you there.
